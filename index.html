                        <p>The children in Bhopal had day of fun and learning when a drawing competition was conducted for them. Kids were asked to use their imaginations and draw whatever they wanted to. They came up with things which they found beautiful or inspiring. Many drew from nature and many picked things and instances from their daily lives.</p>
						<p>More than 100 children, most of who live in deplorable conditions, used painting competition to give shape to their dreams.</p>
						<p>We believe every child is special. Slum children don't get opportunity to showcase their talent. An event like this may help them to give shape to their dreams.</p>

                        <p>On the occasion of teacher's day, Aman Welfare Society gifted music system to the underprivileged students to help them explore their hobbies and dreams apart from academic learning.</p>
                        <p>The future of poor children in India living along the street and slum is in darkness. Due to a lack of attention these children have stolen loot, have addictions, have gone the way of crime. Because alienating get them from all over the place. These children need love and guidance. This exposure enabled the kids to share their story, about their needs and what problems they are going through. Giving a Gift is a wonderful way to reach out to these children and vulnerable families and make a positive difference to their lives, while at the same time giving a gift brought a smile to their face.</p>

The motto of our NGO is- "One small step can make a difference"✨ Keeping this in mind, Aman Welfare Society donated food to the underprivileged section in the Cancer Hospital of Bhopal.</p>
                        <p>Despite significant economic progress in the past decade, there are so many people who do not get food. That's why we're working to feed the hungry. Our volunteers served the meal to the homeless people. We realised from their blessings that we were not feeding food, we're feeding them love and kindness, which is what exactly Amma does.</p>
						<p>The volunteers also said they feel honored and blessed for being able to serve in this way.</p>

Also, with the onset of adolescence, female sports participation drops by more than 20 per cent. This is why we conducted platform for advancement of women and to encourage them in sport's activity.</p>
