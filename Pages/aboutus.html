			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensuring development for all, we facilitate educational opportunities for deaf-mute and people with disability.</li>
				<li>Studies shows that less than half of India’s children go to school. We believe children are future of our 
					and no kid should be denied with the right to education. Thus, we provide learning platforms for welfare 
					of children from scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe.</li>
				<li>We support women and children from all categories; be it untouchable, scheduled caste or differentially abled.</li>
				<li>We run “Yoga” camps in various locations for relieving stress and improve health and physical fitness.</li>
				<li>With 65.46% of female literacy rate as per 2011 census in India, women’s education becomes a crucial topic to 
					think about. Through our community, we try to educate women by organising different events. We also encourage them 
					to show their talents and engage in various activities.</li>
				<li>We work towards upliftment of arts such as music, painting, photography, gardening, literature, sculpture, 
					dance, plays and game.</li>
				<li>We run training programmes for women to make them independent and self-sufficient.</li>
				<li>We have been assisting social activities and schemes of Government. </li>
